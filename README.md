Motivation
==========

* Getting Things Done
* Time management
* Better estimation of work
* Self-improvement
* Statistics

Workflow
========

If you are interested in participating in these sprints, define your
long-term and short-term goals, and ping "mbuf" on irc.freenode.net.

Long-term goals could be your passion or job roles that you want to
pursue such as (but not limited to):

* DevSecOps Engineer
* Security Engineer
* Kernel Engineer
* Systems Programmer
* Web developer
* UI/UX Designer
* Writer
* Document Translator
* Data Engineer
* Data Scientist
* Packager
* Application Developer
* QA Tester

The short-term goals may include the technology and skills that you
need to learn to achieve your long-term goals. The short-term goals are
further sub-divided into tasks which are aligned to sprints.

The tasks can be any one of the following categories: READ, WRITE,
DEV, OPS, EVENT, MEETING.

The sprints are based on the moon calendar. For each sprint, you
decide on the hours you can spend per day, and the list of tasks.

During the sprint, you can send PR with clocked time if you are
already familiar with Emacs and Org mode. Otherwise, you can send your
clocked times in the following format to "mbuf", and also mention the
status of the task (IN_PROGRESS, DONE):

    CLOCK: [2018-02-21 Wed 14:45]--[2018-02-21 Wed 15:00]

At the end of a sprint, a retrospection meeting will be held to review
the same.

It is recommended for participants to wear a heavy watch so that they
have the notion of time.
